Alicia Svenson
I am a graduate of Brown University and have a Master of Architecture degree from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Before entering the MA in Public History program at Northeastern University I worked as a preservation specialist for architectural design and historic preservation consulting firms in New York and Boston, which taught me to appreciate stone in all its forms. This research project was designed as a final project for the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities at Northeastern University.

Thank You
So many people helped me with this project!
