#### Alicia Svenson

I am an architect and a student in the MA in Public History program at Northeastern University. Prior to starting the MA program I worked as a preservation specialist for architectural design and historic preservation consulting firms in New York and Boston, where I learned to appreciate stone in all its forms. This research project was designed as a final project for Northeastern's Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.
