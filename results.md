### Overview

Since the results from my exploration are intimately tied into the methods used I feel they need to be discussed in relation to the method. To this end, the website includes the following sections:


**[Word Frequency Results](https://stonejournal.github.io/reswordfreq/)**

**[Keyword in Context Results](https://stonejournal.github.io/reskeywords/)**

**[Word Vector Results](https://stonejournal.github.io/reswordvec/)**


Each of these sections is designed as a stand-alone essay. Together I hope they provide a view into some of the discussion happening around safety, health, and the environment in the pages of *Stone: An Illustrated Magazine.*
